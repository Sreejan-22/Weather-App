# Weather-App

This is a weather app created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the styling part Bootstrap has been used wherever necessary.

In this application the user is required to enter the name of the place. In response the temperature (in celsius), the weather condition(e.g. cloudy) and whether it's day or night, is shown. 

Accuweather API has been used for this app (https://developer.accuweather.com/).
